        <h2>Web security</h2>
        <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
        <p id="web-security-answer">First of all I would advise the client to use a secure web hosting company, an maybe also maybe hire extra security service. It is important to maintain and update every software the website is using. I would also say it is important to use secure authorization. If it is a website for a company, the whole organization should have a strong password policy. Every user of the website should be required to create strong passwords. It should be run regular security checks and also it should be run regular backup, just in case the website crashes.</p>
